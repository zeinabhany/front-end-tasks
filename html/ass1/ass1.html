                 In the early days of the internet, communication between computers was primarily text-based.

The existing methods of presenting documents were often limited and lacked consistency across different systems.

                HTML continues to evolve, with ongoing developments and proposed features aiming to enhance its capabilities and address emerging needs. 

                The HTML specification has transitioned into a "living standard" approach, moving away from traditional versioning. Instead of discrete versions, HTML is now being continuously developed and updated.
